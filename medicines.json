Non-medical use is common among bodybuilders and athletes to increase muscle mass, strength, and performance, though this is illegal in many sports and countries.",
    "dosage": "Dosage varies greatly depending on the medical condition being treated. Medically supervised doses are usually low and short-term. Illicit or performance-enhancing doses are often dangerously high and taken in cycles (cycling) or in combination with other steroids (stacking).",
    "sideEffect": "Potential side effects include liver damage, jaundice, severe acne, hair loss, increased risk of heart disease and stroke, hypertension, aggressive behavior ('roid rage'), mood swings, infertility, testicular shrinkage, gynecomastia (breast development in men), menstrual irregularities in women, deepened voice, excessive hair growth in women, stunted growth in adolescents, and increased risk of infections due to unsafe injection practices.",
    "precautions": "Use only under strict medical supervision for legitimate medical conditions. Avoid non-prescribed or recreational use due to high risk of severe health consequences and legal issues. Regular monitoring of liver function, cholesterol levels, and hormone levels is essential during treatment.",
    "mechanism": "Anabolic steroids bind to androgen receptors in muscle cells, stimulating protein synthesis and muscle growth. They also increase nitrogen retention in muscle tissues, enhancing recovery and muscle mass. However, they can disrupt the natural hormonal balance, suppressing the body\u2019s own testosterone production and affecting multiple organ systems."

  {
    "name": "Nandrolone Decanoate",
    "description": "Nandrolone Decanoate is a long-acting anabolic steroid derived from testosterone. It has strong anabolic effects with relatively mild androgenic properties, making it popular in clinical settings for treating muscle wasting and anemia, and notorious in the bodybuilding community for off-label performance enhancement.",
    "uses": "Medically used to treat anemia of chronic kidney disease, severe osteoporosis, certain muscle wasting diseases, and sometimes as an adjunct in conditions causing severe involuntary weight loss. Illegally misused by bodybuilders and athletes to increase muscle mass, strength, and recovery.",
    "dosage": "Typical medical doses range from 50\u2013200 mg every 2\u20134 weeks, administered intramuscularly. Bodybuilders often abuse doses far exceeding medical recommendations, sometimes 200\u2013600 mg per week, in cycles lasting 8\u201312 weeks \u2014 which carries significant health risks.",
    "sideEffect": "Possible side effects include liver toxicity, suppression of natural testosterone production, testicular atrophy, gynecomastia due to aromatization to estrogen, infertility, fluid retention, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, acne, oily skin, male-pattern baldness, mood swings, aggression, and in women, deepened voice, excessive body hair, menstrual disturbances, and clitoral enlargement. Long-term misuse can lead to irreversible endocrine and liver damage.",
    "precautions": "Should only be used under prescription and medical supervision. Contraindicated in patients with prostate or breast cancer, liver disease, and heart disease. Regular monitoring of blood counts, liver function, cholesterol levels, and prostate health is critical. Never share needles; improper injection techniques can lead to abscesses and infections.",
    "mechanism": "Nandrolone binds strongly to androgen receptors in muscle cells, enhancing protein synthesis and nitrogen retention, which stimulates muscle growth and repair. Its low conversion to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) reduces androgenic side effects compared to testosterone but increases progestin activity, which can contribute to gynecomastia."

Illegally, it\u2019s often abused by athletes and bodybuilders to enhance muscle mass, strength, and performance.",
    "uses": "Used to treat male hypogonadism (low testosterone), delayed puberty in boys, some cases of breast cancer in women, and gender-affirming hormone therapy for transgender men. Athletes and bodybuilders misuse synthetic testosterone to build muscle and improve recovery.",
    "dosage": "Medically prescribed doses vary based on condition and formulation \u2014 for TRT, typical doses range from 50\u2013200 mg of injectable testosterone every 1\u20132 weeks, or daily gels or patches delivering 5\u201310 mg per day. Non-medical users often take much higher doses, sometimes 300\u20131000+ mg per week, often in cycles of 8\u201316 weeks.",
    "sideEffect": "Possible side effects include acne, oily skin, hair loss (male pattern baldness), gynecomastia (conversion to estrogen), increased aggression or mood swings, infertility due to suppression of natural testosterone production, testicular shrinkage, sleep apnea, elevated red blood cell count (risking clots), liver strain with oral forms, worsening of prostate conditions, and increased cardiovascular risks like heart attack and stroke.",
    "precautions": "Contraindicated in men with prostate or breast cancer. Caution in those with heart, liver, or kidney disease. Regular monitoring of testosterone levels, PSA (prostate-specific antigen), liver function, cholesterol, and hematocrit is vital. Non-prescribed use is illegal and carries significant health risks.",
    "mechanism": "Testosterone binds to androgen receptors in muscle and other tissues, increasing protein synthesis, nitrogen retention, and muscle fiber growth. It\u2019s also partially converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in tissues, increasing androgenic effects, and to estradiol (estrogen) via aromatase, contributing to gynecomastia and fluid retention."

    "name": "Methandienone",
    "description": "Methandienone, commonly known as Dianabol or Dbol, is a potent oral anabolic steroid. Originally developed in the 1950s to help athletes boost performance, it quickly gained fame as one of the first anabolic steroids widely used for muscle building. Due to its significant anabolic effects, it remains popular among bodybuilders, though it\u2019s illegal for non-medical use in most countries.",
    "uses": "Used illegally by athletes and bodybuilders to rapidly increase muscle mass, strength, and performance. Medically, it was once prescribed for muscle-wasting diseases but is now rarely used due to safer alternatives and high abuse potential.",
    "dosage": "Typical non-medical doses range from 15\u201350 mg per day, often split into multiple doses to maintain stable blood levels. Cycles usually last 4\u20136 weeks to limit liver stress. Medical dosages, when used historically, were much lower \u2014 around 2\u20135 mg per day.",
    "sideEffect": "Possible side effects include liver toxicity (it\u2019s hepatotoxic due to its C17-alpha alkylated structure), significant water retention leading to bloating and high blood pressure, acne, oily skin, accelerated hair loss in genetically prone individuals, gynecomastia (due to estrogen conversion), testicular atrophy, suppression of natural testosterone production, mood swings, and increased aggression. Long-term abuse raises risks of liver damage, cardiovascular disease, and infertility.",
    "precautions": "Should never be used without medical supervision. Regular liver function tests are crucial. Anti-estrogens like SERMs or aromatase inhibitors are sometimes used to counter gynecomastia. Not suitable for those with liver disease, heart conditions, or prostate problems. Non-prescribed use is illegal and potentially dangerous.",
    "mechanism": "Methandienone increases protein synthesis, nitrogen retention, and glycogenolysis in muscles, promoting rapid muscle growth and strength gains. It aromatizes easily into estrogen, causing fluid retention and potential estrogenic side effects like gynecomastia. Its oral bioavailability is due to its alkylated structure, but this also makes it toxic to the liver."

  {
    "name": "Stanozolol",
    "description": "Stanozolol, widely known by its trade name Winstrol, is a synthetic anabolic steroid derived from dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It was developed in the 1960s and rose to fame for its powerful anabolic effects paired with minimal androgenic activity, making it a favorite for athletes looking to enhance muscle definition without excessive bulk or water retention. Available in both oral and injectable forms, it\u2019s still used medically for rare conditions, though its main notoriety comes from sports and bodybuilding.",
    "uses": "Non-medically, it\u2019s used by athletes and bodybuilders during cutting cycles to maintain lean muscle mass, enhance vascularity, and boost strength without adding extra weight. Medically, it has been prescribed for treating hereditary angioedema (a rare swelling disorder), anemia, and to promote recovery and weight gain in severe illness or trauma.",
    "dosage": "For performance enhancement, typical non-medical doses range from 25\u201350 mg daily for oral use, or 50 mg every other day if injected. Cycles usually last 4\u20136 weeks to minimize liver strain. Medical doses are far lower, often around 2 mg orally twice a day, depending on the condition being treated.",
    "sideEffect": "Side effects can include significant liver toxicity (especially with oral use, due to its C17-alpha alkylation), joint pain and dryness (due to its non-aromatizing nature, which reduces fluid retention around joints), increased LDL cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol, acne and oily skin, hair thinning or loss in those genetically predisposed, virilization in women (deep voice, body hair), mood swings, and suppression of natural testosterone production. Long-term misuse raises the risk of liver damage, cardiovascular disease, infertility, and ligament injuries due to dry, brittle joints.",
    "precautions": "Use should always be under strict medical supervision if prescribed. Regular monitoring of liver enzymes and cholesterol levels is essential. Not suitable for individuals with pre-existing liver disease, heart problems, or high cholesterol. Women should be especially cautious due to the risk of masculinizing side effects. Combining with other hepatotoxic substances like alcohol increases risks dramatically.",
    "mechanism": "Stanozolol works by binding to androgen receptors, boosting protein synthesis and nitrogen retention in muscle tissue. It also lowers sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), increasing the amount of free, active testosterone in the bloodstream. Unlike many other anabolic steroids, Stanozolol does not convert to estrogen (it doesn\u2019t aromatize), which helps prevent water retention and gynecomastia but contributes to joint dryness and potential ligament stress."

Medically, it\u2019s still used in certain contexts to help patients regain weight after surgery, chronic infection, or severe trauma, and to treat certain cases of bone pain due to osteoporosis.",
    "uses": "In bodybuilding and athletics, Oxandrolone is popular during cutting cycles to preserve lean muscle while shedding body fat. Medically, it\u2019s prescribed for weight gain in underweight patients, counteracting protein catabolism, and in some cases for treating severe burns and osteoporosis.",
    "dosage": "Typical performance-enhancing doses for men range from 20\u201380 mg per day, with cycles lasting 6\u20138 weeks. For women, due to its mild androgenic nature, doses are usually much lower \u2014 around 5\u201320 mg daily to reduce risk of virilization. Medically prescribed doses are much lower, typically 2.5\u201320 mg daily depending on the condition.",
    "sideEffect": "Side effects include mild liver toxicity due to its oral C17-alpha alkylated structure, though it\u2019s considered less hepatotoxic than many other oral steroids. Other side effects can be cholesterol imbalance (lowered HDL and increased LDL), mild suppression of natural testosterone production, acne, oily skin, and potential hair thinning in predisposed individuals. Women may experience deepening of the voice, increased body hair, and menstrual irregularities at higher doses. Long-term misuse can strain the liver and cardiovascular system.",
    "precautions": "Oxandrolone should be used only under medical supervision if prescribed. Regular liver function and lipid profile monitoring are important during cycles. Combining with other hepatotoxic substances, such as alcohol or other oral steroids, raises liver risks. Men should consider post-cycle therapy (PCT) to help restore natural testosterone production. Women should be especially cautious with dosing to avoid masculinizing effects.",
    "mechanism": "Oxandrolone works by binding to androgen receptors, promoting increased protein synthesis and nitrogen retention in muscle tissue. Unlike many steroids, it does not aromatize to estrogen, so there\u2019s little to no risk of water retention or gynecomastia. It\u2019s also known for enhancing phosphocreatine synthesis in muscle cells, contributing to improved strength without significant mass gain."

    "name": "Steroids",
    "description": "Anabolic steroids are synthetic derivatives of testosterone designed to promote muscle growth and enhance athletic performance. They mimic the anabolic (muscle-building) effects of natural testosterone but often with exaggerated potency.",
    "uses": "Medically used to treat delayed puberty, certain types of impotence, wasting conditions like severe weight loss due to chronic illness or HIV/AIDS, and sometimes anemia. Non-medical use is common among bodybuilders and athletes to increase muscle mass, strength, and performance, though this is illegal in many sports and countries.",
    "dosage": "Dosage varies greatly depending on the medical condition being treated. Medically supervised doses are usually low and short-term. Illicit or performance-enhancing doses are often dangerously high and taken in cycles (cycling) or in combination with other steroids (stacking).",
    "sideEffect": "Potential side effects include liver damage, jaundice, severe acne, hair loss, increased risk of heart disease and stroke, hypertension, aggressive behavior ('roid rage'), mood swings, infertility, testicular shrinkage, gynecomastia (breast development in men), menstrual irregularities in women, deepened voice, excessive hair growth in women, stunted growth in adolescents, and increased risk of infections due to unsafe injection practices.",
    "precautions": "Use only under strict medical supervision for legitimate medical conditions. Avoid non-prescribed or recreational use due to high risk of severe health consequences and legal issues. Regular monitoring of liver function, cholesterol levels, and hormone levels is essential during treatment.",
    "mechanism": "Anabolic steroids bind to androgen receptors in muscle cells, stimulating protein synthesis and muscle growth. They also increase nitrogen retention in muscle tissues, enhancing recovery and muscle mass. However, they can disrupt the natural hormonal balance, suppressing the body\u2019s own testosterone production and affecting multiple organ systems."

    "uses": "Medically used to treat delayed puberty, certain types of impotence, wasting conditions like severe weight loss due to chronic illness or HIV/AIDS, and sometimes anemia. Non-medical use is common among bodybuilders and athletes to increase muscle mass, strength, and performance, though this is illegal in many sports and countries.",
    "dosage": "Dosage varies greatly depending on the medical condition being treated. Medically supervised doses are usually low and short-term. Illicit or performance-enhancing doses are often dangerously high and taken in cycles (cycling) or in combination with other steroids (stacking).",
    "sideEffect": "Potential side effects include liver damage, jaundice, severe acne, hair loss, increased risk of heart disease and stroke, hypertension, aggressive behavior ('roid rage'), mood swings, infertility, testicular shrinkage, gynecomastia (breast development in men), menstrual irregularities in women, deepened voice, excessive hair growth in women, stunted growth in adolescents, and increased risk of infections due to unsafe injection practices.",
    "precautions": "Use only under strict medical supervision for legitimate medical conditions. Avoid non-prescribed or recreational use due to high risk of severe health consequences and legal issues. Regular monitoring of liver function, cholesterol levels, and hormone levels is essential during treatment.",
    "mechanism": "Anabolic steroids bind to androgen receptors in muscle cells, stimulating protein synthesis and muscle growth. They also increase nitrogen retention in muscle tissues, enhancing recovery and muscle mass. However, they can disrupt the natural hormonal balance, suppressing the body’s own testosterone production and affecting multiple organ systems."

  {
    "name": "Nandrolone Decanoate",
    "description": "Nandrolone Decanoate is a long-acting anabolic steroid derived from testosterone. It has strong anabolic effects with relatively mild androgenic properties, making it popular in clinical settings for treating muscle wasting and anemia, and notorious in the bodybuilding community for off-label performance enhancement.",
    "uses": "Medically used to treat anemia of chronic kidney disease, severe osteoporosis, certain muscle wasting diseases, and sometimes as an adjunct in conditions causing severe involuntary weight loss. Illegally misused by bodybuilders and athletes to increase muscle mass, strength, and recovery.",
    "dosage": "Typical medical doses range from 50–200 mg every 2–4 weeks, administered intramuscularly. Bodybuilders often abuse doses far exceeding medical recommendations, sometimes 200–600 mg per week, in cycles lasting 8–12 weeks — which carries significant health risks.",
    "sideEffect": "Possible side effects include liver toxicity, suppression of natural testosterone production, testicular atrophy, gynecomastia due to aromatization to estrogen, infertility, fluid retention, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, acne, oily skin, male-pattern baldness, mood swings, aggression, and in women, deepened voice, excessive body hair, menstrual disturbances, and clitoral enlargement. Long-term misuse can lead to irreversible endocrine and liver damage.",
    "precautions": "Should only be used under prescription and medical supervision. Contraindicated in patients with prostate or breast cancer, liver disease, and heart disease. Regular monitoring of blood counts, liver function, cholesterol levels, and prostate health is critical. Never share needles; improper injection techniques can lead to abscesses and infections.",
    "mechanism": "Nandrolone binds strongly to androgen receptors in muscle cells, enhancing protein synthesis and nitrogen retention, which stimulates muscle growth and repair. Its low conversion to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) reduces androgenic side effects compared to testosterone but increases progestin activity, which can contribute to gynecomastia."

Illegally, it’s often abused by athletes and bodybuilders to enhance muscle mass, strength, and performance.",
    "uses": "Used to treat male hypogonadism (low testosterone), delayed puberty in boys, some cases of breast cancer in women, and gender-affirming hormone therapy for transgender men. Athletes and bodybuilders misuse synthetic testosterone to build muscle and improve recovery.",
    "dosage": "Medically prescribed doses vary based on condition and formulation — for TRT, typical doses range from 50–200 mg of injectable testosterone every 1–2 weeks, or daily gels or patches delivering 5–10 mg per day. Non-medical users often take much higher doses, sometimes 300–1000+ mg per week, often in cycles of 8–16 weeks.",
    "sideEffect": "Possible side effects include acne, oily skin, hair loss (male pattern baldness), gynecomastia (conversion to estrogen), increased aggression or mood swings, infertility due to suppression of natural testosterone production, testicular shrinkage, sleep apnea, elevated red blood cell count (risking clots), liver strain with oral forms, worsening of prostate conditions, and increased cardiovascular risks like heart attack and stroke.",
    "precautions": "Contraindicated in men with prostate or breast cancer. Caution in those with heart, liver, or kidney disease. Regular monitoring of testosterone levels, PSA (prostate-specific antigen), liver function, cholesterol, and hematocrit is vital. Non-prescribed use is illegal and carries significant health risks.",
    "mechanism": "Testosterone binds to androgen receptors in muscle and other tissues, increasing protein synthesis, nitrogen retention, and muscle fiber growth. It’s also partially converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in tissues, increasing androgenic effects, and to estradiol (estrogen) via aromatase, contributing to gynecomastia and fluid retention."

Due to its significant anabolic effects, it remains popular among bodybuilders, though it’s illegal for non-medical use in most countries.",
    "uses": "Used illegally by athletes and bodybuilders to rapidly increase muscle mass, strength, and performance. Medically, it was once prescribed for muscle-wasting diseases but is now rarely used due to safer alternatives and high abuse potential.",
    "dosage": "Typical non-medical doses range from 15–50 mg per day, often split into multiple doses to maintain stable blood levels. Cycles usually last 4–6 weeks to limit liver stress. Medical dosages, when used historically, were much lower — around 2–5 mg per day.",
    "sideEffect": "Possible side effects include liver toxicity (it’s hepatotoxic due to its C17-alpha alkylated structure), significant water retention leading to bloating and high blood pressure, acne, oily skin, accelerated hair loss in genetically prone individuals, gynecomastia (due to estrogen conversion), testicular atrophy, suppression of natural testosterone production, mood swings, and increased aggression. Long-term abuse raises risks of liver damage, cardiovascular disease, and infertility.",
    "precautions": "Should never be used without medical supervision. Regular liver function tests are crucial. Anti-estrogens like SERMs or aromatase inhibitors are sometimes used to counter gynecomastia. Not suitable for those with liver disease, heart conditions, or prostate problems. Non-prescribed use is illegal and potentially dangerous.",
    "mechanism": "Methandienone increases protein synthesis, nitrogen retention, and glycogenolysis in muscles, promoting rapid muscle growth and strength gains. It aromatizes easily into estrogen, causing fluid retention and potential estrogenic side effects like gynecomastia. Its oral bioavailability is due to its alkylated structure, but this also makes it toxic to the liver."

    "name": "Stanozolol",
    "description": "Stanozolol, widely known by its trade name Winstrol, is a synthetic anabolic steroid derived from dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It was developed in the 1960s and rose to fame for its powerful anabolic effects paired with minimal androgenic activity, making it a favorite for athletes looking to enhance muscle definition without excessive bulk or water retention. Available in both oral and injectable forms, it’s still used medically for rare conditions, though its main notoriety comes from sports and bodybuilding.",
    "uses": "Non-medically, it’s used by athletes and bodybuilders during cutting cycles to maintain lean muscle mass, enhance vascularity, and boost strength without adding extra weight. Medically, it has been prescribed for treating hereditary angioedema (a rare swelling disorder), anemia, and to promote recovery and weight gain in severe illness or trauma.",
    "dosage": "For performance enhancement, typical non-medical doses range from 25–50 mg daily for oral use, or 50 mg every other day if injected. Cycles usually last 4–6 weeks to minimize liver strain. Medical doses are far lower, often around 2 mg orally twice a day, depending on the condition being treated.",
    "sideEffect": "Side effects can include significant liver toxicity (especially with oral use, due to its C17-alpha alkylation), joint pain and dryness (due to its non-aromatizing nature, which reduces fluid retention around joints), increased LDL cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol, acne and oily skin, hair thinning or loss in those genetically predisposed, virilization in women (deep voice, body hair), mood swings, and suppression of natural testosterone production. Long-term misuse raises the risk of liver damage, cardiovascular disease, infertility, and ligament injuries due to dry, brittle joints.",
    "precautions": "Use should always be under strict medical supervision if prescribed. Regular monitoring of liver enzymes and cholesterol levels is essential. Not suitable for individuals with pre-existing liver disease, heart problems, or high cholesterol. Women should be especially cautious due to the risk of masculinizing side effects. Combining with other hepatotoxic substances like alcohol increases risks dramatically.",
    "mechanism": "Stanozolol works by binding to androgen receptors, boosting protein synthesis and nitrogen retention in muscle tissue. It also lowers sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), increasing the amount of free, active testosterone in the bloodstream. Unlike many other anabolic steroids, Stanozolol does not convert to estrogen (it doesn’t aromatize), which helps prevent water retention and gynecomastia but contributes to joint dryness and potential ligament stress."

    "name": "Oxandrolone",
    "description": "Oxandrolone, commonly known by its trade name Anavar, is a mild yet highly effective oral anabolic steroid developed in the 1960s. It’s prized for its ability to promote lean muscle gains, boost strength, and aid in recovery without excessive androgenic or estrogenic side effects. Medically, it’s still used in certain contexts to help patients regain weight after surgery, chronic infection, or severe trauma, and to treat certain cases of bone pain due to osteoporosis.",
    "uses": "In bodybuilding and athletics, Oxandrolone is popular during cutting cycles to preserve lean muscle while shedding body fat. Medically, it’s prescribed for weight gain in underweight patients, counteracting protein catabolism, and in some cases for treating severe burns and osteoporosis.",
    "dosage": "Typical performance-enhancing doses for men range from 20–80 mg per day, with cycles lasting 6–8 weeks. For women, due to its mild androgenic nature, doses are usually much lower — around 5–20 mg daily to reduce risk of virilization. Medically prescribed doses are much lower, typically 2.5–20 mg daily depending on the condition.",
    "sideEffect": "Side effects include mild liver toxicity due to its oral C17-alpha alkylated structure, though it’s considered less hepatotoxic than many other oral steroids. Other side effects can be cholesterol imbalance (lowered HDL and increased LDL), mild suppression of natural testosterone production, acne, oily skin, and potential hair thinning in predisposed individuals. Women may experience deepening of the voice, increased body hair, and menstrual irregularities at higher doses. Long-term misuse can strain the liver and cardiovascular system.",
    "precautions": "Oxandrolone should be used only under medical supervision if prescribed. Regular liver function and lipid profile monitoring are important during cycles. Combining with other hepatotoxic substances, such as alcohol or other oral steroids, raises liver risks. Men should consider post-cycle therapy (PCT) to help restore natural testosterone production. Women should be especially cautious with dosing to avoid masculinizing effects.",
    "mechanism": "Oxandrolone works by binding to androgen receptors, promoting increased protein synthesis and nitrogen retention in muscle tissue. Unlike many steroids, it does not aromatize to estrogen, so there’s little to no risk of water retention or gynecomastia. It’s also known for enhancing phosphocreatine synthesis in muscle cells, contributing to improved strength without significant mass gain."

    "name": "Steroids",
    "description": "Anabolic steroids are synthetic derivatives of testosterone designed to promote muscle growth and enhance athletic performance. They mimic the anabolic (muscle-building) effects of natural testosterone but often with exaggerated potency.",
    "uses": "Medically used to treat delayed puberty, certain types of impotence, wasting conditions like severe weight loss due to chronic illness or HIV/AIDS, and sometimes anemia. Non-medical use is common among bodybuilders and athletes to increase muscle mass, strength, and performance, though this is illegal in many sports and countries.",
    "dosage": "Dosage varies greatly depending on the medical condition being treated. Medically supervised doses are usually low and short-term. Illicit or performance-enhancing doses are often dangerously high and taken in cycles (cycling) or in combination with other steroids (stacking).",
    "sideEffect": "Potential side effects include liver damage, jaundice, severe acne, hair loss, increased risk of heart disease and stroke, hypertension, aggressive behavior ('roid rage'), mood swings, infertility, testicular shrinkage, gynecomastia (breast development in men), menstrual irregularities in women, deepened voice, excessive hair growth in women, stunted growth in adolescents, and increased risk of infections due to unsafe injection practices.",
    "precautions": "Use only under strict medical supervision for legitimate medical conditions. Avoid non-prescribed or recreational use due to high risk of severe health consequences and legal issues. Regular monitoring of liver function, cholesterol levels, and hormone levels is essential during treatment.",
    "mechanism": "Anabolic steroids bind to androgen receptors in muscle cells, stimulating protein synthesis and muscle growth. They also increase nitrogen retention in muscle tissues, enhancing recovery and muscle mass. However, they can disrupt the natural hormonal balance, suppressing the body’s own testosterone production and affecting multiple organ systems."
